# Molecular interactions REST API server
This repo hosts the code necessary to run the REST API server that manages the endpoints to query the Molecular interactions database resource from Ensembl.
The pipeline that populates the actual database (Map_interspecies_interactions) uses a separate repository hosted at https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-production-imported
